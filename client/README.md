## Description

This is a ticketing system called Strombo that I built using the MERN stack. Users can log into their own profile to create projects along with tickets for those projects. Tickets can then be claimed by a user and will show up in their tasks. Once a user claims a ticket, the status of the ticket will automatically be changed to "In progress" until the ticket is marked as complete. There is also functionality built in to reopen tickets that were previously marked as complete if needed.
